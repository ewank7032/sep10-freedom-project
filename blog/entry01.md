# Entry 1: Deciding on a Topic (Nuclear Energy Industry)

## Choosing a Topic

I have chosen to look into the nuclear energy industry for this project. During one of the SEP lessons, I was taught that to find my dream job, I'd have to think: Do I enjoy doing this? Is it important to the world? Am I good at this or determined to get better at it? I went through many jobs and fields until I arrived here. I enjoyed researching about nuclear reactors and operating a simplified one in a simulation, nuclear energy heavily contributes to the world, and it involves physics and engineering. Even though I have failed the physics regents last grade I am determined to get better at it because I actually enjoyed that subject. As for engineering, I'm also willing to learn more about it. I'm also specifically interested in the reactor operator job in this field. It is very ambitious, but I'm determined. Before even starting SEP I have been reading about different nuclear reactor types such as [pressurized water reactors (PWR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor) and [boiling water reactors (BWR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor), including their [safety systems (BWRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor_safety_systems#Reactor_Protection_System_(RPS)) and [nuclear engineering in general.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering)

Unfortunately I did not find any backup topics since the method I was given to find a dream job didn't lead me anywhere else.

## EDP

Currently in the first stage of the engineering design process where I define the problem. I've definitely noticed that when I shared my topic with some of my friends and family, they were incredibly concerned with the safety of nuclear power plants. Theres one problem. Some people are simply not informed enough on the safety of nuclear power due to past incidents.

# Skills

#### Time Management

I was warned this would not be completable if I procrastinated until the last day, so I had to set aside some time every once in a while in the week whether I liked it or not to write this entry instead of being unproductive. It wasn't so bad, every once in a while it feels nice for me to force my way through procrastination so I can actually feel relieved going through my day.

#### Consideration

Having to follow a format for writing this entry is a reminder to me that other people will be reading this entry, not just myself, and they won't know where all the content is in the back of their minds.
