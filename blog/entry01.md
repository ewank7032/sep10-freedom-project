## Choosing a Topic

I have chosen to look into the nuclear energy industry for this project. During one of the SEP lessons, I was taught that to find my dream job, I'd have to think: Do I enjoy doing this? Is it important to the world? Am I good at this or determined to get better at it? I went through many jobs and fields until I arrived here. I enjoyed researching about nuclear reactors and operating a simplified one in a simulation, nuclear energy heavily contributes to the world, and it involves physics. Even though I have failed the physics regents last grade I am determined to get better at it because I actually enjoyed that subject. I'm also specifically interested in the reactor operator job in this field. It is very ambitious, but I'm determined.

Some of the articles I've looked at:

[Pressurized Water Reactors, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor)

[Boiling Water Reactors, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor)

[BWR Reactor Safety Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor_safety_systems#Reactor_Protection_System_(RPS))
