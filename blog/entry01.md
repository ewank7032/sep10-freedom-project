## Choosing a Topic

I have chosen to look into the nuclear energy industry for this project. During one of the SEP lessons, I was taught that to find my dream job, I'd have to think: Do I enjoy doing this? Is it important to the world? Am I good at this or determined to get better at it? I went through many jobs and fields until I arrived here. I enjoyed researching about nuclear reactors and operating a simplified one in a simulation, nuclear energy heavily contributes to the world, and it involves physics and engineering. Even though I have failed the physics regents last grade I am determined to get better at it because I actually enjoyed that subject. As for engineering, I'm also willing to learn more about it. I'm also specifically interested in the reactor operator job in this field. It is very ambitious, but I'm determined.

Some of the articles I've looked at:

[Pressurized Water Reactors, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor)

[Boiling Water Reactors, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor)

[BWR Reactor Safety Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor_safety_systems#Reactor_Protection_System_(RPS))

[Nuclear Engineering in General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering)

I did not manage to find some suitable backup topics unfortunately.

## EDP

Currently in the first stage of the engineering design process where I define the problem. I've definitely noticed that when I shared my topic with some of my friends and family, they were incredibly concerned with the safety of nuclear power plants. Theres one problem. Some people are simply not informed enough on the safety of nuclear power.

# Skills

#### Problem Decomposition

I realized I didn't have a straightforward answer for step 1 of the EDP. What problem could there be? But I managed to break down the task and remembered some concerns that people have had about my topic.

#### Time Management
