## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Most highly-fidelity software used by nuclear reactor operators are exclusive and cannot be accessed.
  * Highly detailed software for personal use is rare simply because operation of a nuclear reactor is boring, and some information may be classified.
* The software here will give you a brief overview of nuclear reactors.

## Part A: existing technology
* Energy Encyclopedia
  * This site contains many 3D Models of nuclear reactors with great detail in explanations.
  * We'll be focusing on the two main types that are in use in the commercial nuclear power industry.
  * First and most common, the Pressurized Water Reactor.
    * [Link](https://3d.energyencyclopedia.com/npp-pwr/)
    * Gives an overview of one reactor unit and its systems.
    * Labeled in detail and allows you to view certain sectors in greater detail.
    * Includes some video overviews.
  * Second and second most common, the Boiling Water Reactor.
    * [Link](https://3d.energyencyclopedia.com/npp-bwr)
    * Same details as above.
* University of Manchester Nuclear Reactor Simulation
  * [Link](https://dalton-nrs.manchester.ac.uk/)
  * Gives you a very barebones feel of operating a nuclear reactor specifically a Pressurized Water Reactor.
  * Provides some explanation of operations.
  * Has a system for you to meet power demands.

## Part B: possible future technology
* Idea
  * Detail
